            <h2> WHO WE ARE</h2>
        Free the Trees was founded in 2019 by a group of students who are passionate about reversing the effects of climate change. We believe that by engaging the public with knowledge of the potential of tree plantation, we can work to achieve a better future. Our goal is to raise funds to plant trees all over the country, in areas most affected by deforestation.

            <h2> WHY WE EXIST </h2>
        We are driven to combat the effects of deforestation and climate change, and create a world where nature thrives. Our mission is to create a nation filled with flora and faura, with hopes to expand globally.

            <h2> HOW WE DO IT </h2>
        To make our vision a reality, we need your help. We are currently in the developmental stage of our start-up, and hope to create an interactive interface where you, the donor, are able to select the location and species of tree to plant.

            <h2> WHERE WE MAKE THE CHANGE </h2>
        All of our trees will be planted by local volunteers, in areas you are able to select from. The choices will range between regions that need it the most, and have potential to create greatest benefit.
